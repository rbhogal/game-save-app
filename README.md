# WIP

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work enviornment. 

* This app's design was inspired from varous gaming-related websites such as [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/) and [IGDB.com](https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild) to name a few
* I organized my work and tasks on a Kanban board using Notion: [Screenshot of tasks]()

## How to naviage this project

## Why I built the project this way

This was my very first react and redux project (other than many small tutorial based react projects) and I didn't use Sass or CSS Modules because I wanted to maintain focus striclty on Javascript and React/Redux. 

## If I had more time I would change this

* Refactor some code such as [this]()
* Add some unit, integration, and end-to-end testing using Jest and React Testing Library

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, run:

`npm start`
